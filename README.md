# ArduinoLubeController
Using the Arduino Mini as a Lube controller for Machine lubrication

I was searching for a simple cost effective solution  to make a lube time with manual lubrication and programmable timer witch I could apply to any machine I needed:

. input:    Maunual input button

. input:    Lube pressure switch to confirm lube pressure

. output:  Green lamp to show lube pump is running

. output:  Red lamp  no olio pressure and if blinking the pressure has failed to turn on after 3 tries disabling the pump because you have a leak or a faulty pressure switch

. output:  Lube pump on
