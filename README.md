# ArduinoUnoLubController
Using the Arduino uno as a Lub controller for Machine lubrification

I was serching for a simple cost effective solutione to make a lub time with manual lubrification and pre programmed time witch I could aply to any machine i needed
it has:
. input:   Maunual input button
. input:   Lub pressure switch to confirm lub pressure
. output:  Green lamp to show lub pump is running
. output:  Red lamp  no olio pressure and if blinking the pressure has failed to turn on after 3 tries disabling the pump because you have a leak or a faulty pressure switch
. output: lub pump on
